# Artificial Pollination Via Computer Vision
## What is this repo?
Within this repo, a fully functioning object detection system is developed utilising transfer learning to produce accurate
neural-network models. Additionally, numerous aspects of the models are investigated to optimise
the process. The vision system is capable of detecting tomato flowers within a typical indoor environment (greenhouses, vertical farm's, small plot's etc)

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to produce a vision system capable of running on a low-end system to be intergrated into a robotic arm. A plan for other parts of the pollinator is also conceived, with sections for depth estimation, intrinsic camera properties and path finding.

## Deployment
Here you can see a deployment of one of the models produced.

## Data-sets
This repo also contains a bespoke dataset and a online-sourced dataset for training and compairson purposes.
